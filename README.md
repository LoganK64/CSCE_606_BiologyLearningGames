### Instructions on Game data and Deployment:
Coming Soon!!!

<!---
1. Connect to FTP Server using the credentials 
2. Navigate to /futuredogter.com/stepstone/workArea/NIH-SEPA-1/activityLib/practice_c1/apps
3. Here you will find our two apps Scramble and guessUp
4. Under these folders inside the folder js, there exists a game_data.js file that is the file containing the words and their respective 5. hints and image names.
5. For the guessUp game, there exists an additional folder containing images that are associated with the words of the game. Each word will contain a hint, a category, and an image to help solve the game. Categories are Plant, Animal or Virus, and Unicellular.
6. For the Scramble game, there are three levels of difficulty, and words need to be entered under the corresponding difficulty level they wished to be a part of.
7. The words themselves cannot contain spaces or other non-alphabetic characters.
8. The image file names and words must be unique.
9. After successfully uploading and/or changing the code on the FTP server, contact the vetmed team so that they will update the changes on the vetmed server
