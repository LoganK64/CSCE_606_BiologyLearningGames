  {
    question: "Given a data table which variables are studied by scientist to understand how they affect the outcomes?",
    choices: ["Independent Variables", "Dependent Variables", "Controlled Variables"],
    explanation: "The independent variable is the one that the scientist chooses to study to hypothesize their affect on the outcomes."
  },
  {
    question: "Given a data table which variables respond to the change made to the independent variables?",
    choices: ["Dependent Variables", "Independent Variables", "Controlled Variables"],
    explanation: "Definition: The dependent variables are the things that respond to the change made to the independent variables."
  },
  {
    question: "Given a data table which variables are constant?",
    choices: ["Controlled Variables", "Independent Variables", "Dependent Variables"],
    explanation: "Controlled variables are other factors which remain constant. These are important to consider when designing experiments."
  },
  {
    question: "Given a data table what are the contents of the table apart from variables?",
    choices: ["All the options", "Measurable Units", "Information or Data", "Title"],
    explanation: "Measurable Units telling how the variables were measured. Information or Data recorded in the proper column for the corresponding variable. Title describes the variables and what is being measured."
  },
  {
    question: "How do each of the 50 states compare in the percentage of kindergartners who received their MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine?",
    choices: ["A Bar Graph", "A Pie Chart", "A Line Graph"],
    explanation: "Bar graphs show how variables compare to one another. They can also show change over time, but this works best if the changes are large."
  },
  {
    question: "A scientist wants to know what proportion of all influenza positive tests is due to each influenza virus subtype.",
    choices: ["A Pie Chart", "A Bar Graph", "A Line Graph"],
    explanation: "Pie charts show the parts of a whole. They are useful in determining the percentage or proportion of something."
  },
  {
    question: "Which type of graph will best fit the data. How has the number of rabies cases in wildlife changed from 1967 to 2017?",
    choices: ["A Line Graph", "A Pie Chart", "A Bar Graph"],
    explanation: "Line graphs show how a variable changes over time. They are useful in describing trends."
  },
  {
    question: "Statistical quantity determined by adding set of numbers together and dividing by how many numbers are present.",
    choices: ["Mean", "Median", "Mode"],
    explanation: "Definition: The mean is the average of a set of numbers, determined by adding them together and dividing by how many numbers are present."
  },
  {
    question: "Statistical quantity determined by the number in the middle of the smallest and largest of a set of numbers.",
    choices: ["Median", "Mean", "Mode"],
    explanation: "Definition: The median is the middle value between the smallest and largest of a set of numbers. It is the number in the middle."
  },
  {
    question: "Statistical quantity determined by the number that appears most often in a data set.",
    choices: ["Mode", "Mean", "Median"],
    explanation: "Definition: The mode is the number that appears most often in a data set. It only has significance if numbers are repeated."
  },
  {
    question: "Statistical quantity determined by the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in a set of numbers.",
    choices: ["Range", "Mean", "Median", "Mode"],
    explanation: "Definition: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in a set of numbers."
  },
