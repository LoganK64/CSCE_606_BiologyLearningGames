  {
	question: "Which of the following is not an abiotic factor?",
	choices: ["Fungi", "Oxygen", "Soil"],
	explanation: "An abiotic factor of an ecosystem are its nonliving components. Since fungi is living, it would be a biotic factor."
  },
  {
	question: "Which type of biotic organisms make their own food?",
	choices: ["Autotrophs", "Heterotrophs", "Detritivores"],
	explanation: "Autotrophs make their own food, while heterotrophs eat producers or other consumers and detritivores break down dead material."
  },
  {
    question: "Which type of consumer eats both plants and animals?",
    choices: ["Omnivores", "Herbivores", "Carnivores"],
    explanation: "Omnivores eat both plants and animals, whereas herbivores eat only plants and carnivores eat only animals."
  },
  {
    question: "If you were to travel from Alaska to Kansas, you would travel through the following biomes",
    choices: ["Tundra, taiga, temperate deciduous forest, grasslands", "Tundra, taiga, desert, tropical rainforest", "Taiga, grasslands, desert, tropical rainforest", "Temperate deciduous forest, grasslands, desert, tropical rainforest"],
    explanation: "Alaska: Tundra, Canada: Taiga, Midwest: Temperate Deciduous Forest, Kansas: Grasslands."
  },
  {
    question: "In a community, producers are _____ which convert light energy to chemical energy in a process called _______.",
    choices: ["Autotrophs, Photosynthesis", "Heterotrophs, Photosynthesis", "Heterotrophs, Respiration", "Autotrophs, Respiration"],
    explanation: "Photosynthesis: The process through which producers use the sun's energy to make their own food, Autotrophs: An organism that is able to form nutritional organic substances from simple inorganic substances such as carbon dioxide."
  },
  {
    question: "Heterotrophs make their own food from air, water, and the sun's energy.",
    choices: ["False", "True"],
    explanation: "Heterotrophs: These organisms eat producers or other consumers."
  },
  {
    question: "In addition to producers and consumers, healthy communities must have ________, bacteria and fungi which recycle detritus.",
    choices: ["Decomposers", "Autotrophs", "Spontaneous Combustion", "Viruses"],
    explanation: "An organism, especially a soil bacterium, fungus, or invertebrate, that decomposes organic material."
  },
  {
    question: "Each organism has its own _____ or function in a community, and is part of the ________ or web of life.",
    choices: ["Niche, Food chain", "Location, Food chain", "Specialty, Chaos", "Habitat, Niche"],
    explanation: "In ecology, a niche is the role or job of a species in a habitat. Food chain, in ecology, the sequence of transfers of matter and energy in the form of food from organism to organism."
  },
  {
    question: "In a typical ecological pyramid, cows are good examples of _____ consumers because they are _________.",
    choices: ["Primary, Herbivores", "Secondary, Omnivores", "Tertiary, Herbivores", "Primary, Carnivores"],
    explanation: "Herbivores: An animal that gets its energy from eating plants alone, Primary consumers: A primary consumer is an organism that feeds on producers (plants)."
  },
  {
    question: "Humans are considered to be _____ consumers because we eat carnivores, omnivores, herbivores, and producers.",
    choices: ["Tertiary", "Primary", "Secondary", "Quaternary"],
    explanation: "Tertiary consumers, sometimes also known as apex predators, are usually at the top of food chains, capable of feeding on secondary consumers and primary consumers. Tertiary consumers can be either fully carnivorous or omnivorous. Humans are an example of a tertiary consumer. Secondary and tertiary consumers both must hunt for their food so they are referred to as predators."
  },
  {
    question: "When two organisms live in a close association, and both benefit, the relationship is called _______.",
    choices: ["Symbiosis", "Commensalism", "Parasitism", "Pathogenesis"],
    explanation: "In Ecology, Symbiosis is a close ecological relationship between the individuals of two (or more) different species, typically to the advantage of both.."
  },
  {
    question: "The _______ is the maximum number of individuals that a habitat can support.",
    choices: ["Carrying capacity", "Population mean", "J curve", "Population growth rate"],
    explanation: "The number of people, other living organisms, or crops that a region can support without environmental degradation."
  },
  {
    question: "In an environment with unlimited resources and space, and which lacks competition or predation, the expected population growth rate would be:",
    choices: ["Exponential", "Logistic", "Arithmetic", "Negative"],
    explanation: "Exponential growth rate the rate becomes ever more rapid in proportion to the growing total number or size."
  },
  {
    question: "In an ecological succession, lichens are _____ while trees would be members of the ________.",
    choices: ["Pioneer organisms, Climax community", "Seral organisms, Pioneer community", "Climax organisms, Pioneer community", "Omnivores, Primary producers"],
    explanation: "The pioneer species are hardy species which are the first to colonize barren environments or previously biodiverse steady-state ecosystems that have been disrupted, such as by fire. Lichens grow on rocks without soil, so may be among the first of life forms, and break down the rocks into soil for plants. An ecological community in which populations of plants or animals remain stable and exist in balance with each other and their environment."
